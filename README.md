# Mobile_Price_Range_prediction
# Problem Statement : - In the competitive mobile phone market companies want to understand sales data of mobile phones and factors which drive the prices. The objective is to find out some relation between features of a mobile phone(eg:- RAM, Internal Memory, etc) and its selling price. In this problem, we do not have to predict the actual price but a price range indicating how high the price is.

# Project Summary - In today's world, mobile phones have become a necessity for nearly every individual, and it's undeniable. It's fair to say that technology is rapidly evolving; over the last decade, every month seems to bring new advancements to the market. Mobile manufacturers constantly launch updated versions with new features at a remarkable pace, resulting in thousands of mobiles being sold daily. In such a fast-paced and competitive market, mobile companies must set optimal prices to compete with their rivals.

- Analyzing the data for Null and Duplicate values and tackling them using different techniques.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
- Hypothesis Testing between Categorical and Numerical variables.
- Handling Outliers.
- Feature selection and Feature Manipulation.
- Scaling the data using StandardScaler.
- Splitting the data.
- ML model implementation with Cross- Validation & Hyperparameter Tuning.

  # Conclusion
  After analyzing the dataset, I discovered that features such as RAM, battery power, etc., are pivotal in determining the price of a mobile phone.

- Our EDA analysis indicates a direct correlation between increased RAM in a mobile phone and its price.
- Battery power is equally influential in determining the price of a mobile device.
- RAM, battery power, and pixel can play significant roles in defining the price range of a mobile phone.
- 
Overall The XGBoost model performs exceptionally well on both the training and testing data.
